 Remote Procedure Call Identity Squashing via x.509 Certificate Fields
                 draft-cel-nfsv4-othername-spec-latest

Abstract

   This document extends RPC-with-TLS, as described in [RFC9289], so
   that a client's x.509 certificate may carry instructions to the RPC
   server to execute all RPC transactions from that client as a single
   user identity.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   The Remote Procedure Call version 2 protocol (RPC, for short) has
   been a Proposed Standard for three decades (see [RFC5531] and its
   antecedents).  Several important upper layer protocols, such as the
   family of Network File System protocols (most recently described in
   [RFC8881] are based on RPC.

   In 2022, the IETF published [RFC9289], which specifies a mechanism by
   which RPC transactions can be cryptographically protected during
   transit.  This protection includes maintaining confidentiality and
   integrity, and the authentication of the communicating peers.

1.2.  Problem Statement

   Section 4.2 of [RFC9289] states that:

      RPC user authentication is not affected by the use of transport
      layer security.  When a client presents a TLS peer identity to an
      RPC server, the protocol extension described in the current
      document provides no way for the server to know whether that
      identity represents one RPC user on that client or is shared
      amongst many RPC users.  Therefore, a server implementation cannot
      utilize the remote TLS peer identity to authenticate RPC users.

      |  Insert use cases or user stories here.

   When an RPC server replaces incoming RPC user identities with a
   single user identity, for brevity we will refer to this as "identity
   squashing".

1.3.  Summary of Proposed Solution

   In the interest of enabling the independent creation of
   interoperating implementations of RPC identity squashing, this
   document proposes the use of the x.509 SubjectAltName otherName field
   to carry a RPC user identity.  For these user squashing instructions,
   this document establishes a fixed object identifier carried in the
   "type-id" part of the otherName field, and specifies the format of
   the "value" part of the otherName field when "type-id" carries the
   new object identifier.  The document also provides normative guidance
   on how the "value" is to be interpreted by RPC servers.

1.4.  Open Questions

   *  Should this be an NFS-only feature, or should it be an RPC-layer
      feature?

   *  Standardizing a fixed OID is necessary for interoperability, but
      are we required to allocate that OID from a particular arc?

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  x.509 Certificate SubjectAltName Field

   As specified in Section 4.2.1.6 of [RFC5280]:

      The subjectAltName MAY carry additional name types through the use
      of the otherName field.  The format and semantics of the name are
      indicated through the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in the type-id field.  The
      name itself is conveyed as value field in otherName.

3.1.  Requirement for otherName OID

      |  Summary of guidelines regarding use of x.509 SubjectAltName
      |  field.  Are there any requirements, and does this proposal
      |  follow those requirements and guidelines?

3.2.  Format of New otherName Blob

      |  Follow recommendations of draft-ietf-nfsv4-
      |  internationalization-latest to form an internationalized
      |  "user@domain" string similar to NFSv4 ID map strings.

4.  Implementation Status

      |  This section is to be removed before publishing this document
      |  as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.

   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

4.1.  FreeBSD NFS Server and Client

   Organization:  FreeBSD

   URL:  https://www.freebsd.org (https://www.freebsd.org)

   Maturity:  Complete.

   Coverage:  The proposed mechanism has been implemented in its
      entirety using an OID from the FreeBSD arc.

   Licensing:  BSD 3-clause

   Implementation experience:  None to report

5.  Security Considerations

6.  IANA Considerations

      |  Insert request for allocation of a SubjectAltName : otherName
      |  object identifier
